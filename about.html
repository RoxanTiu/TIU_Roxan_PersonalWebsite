Since it is my first time to create a website, let me introduce myself to you. I'm Roxan Salarza Tiu. A Bachelor of Science in Information of Technology, third year student at University of Southeastern Philippnes. I am grateful to explore the HTML5 and CSS3 and apply it to create my own personal website that will showcase my information. It was a big challenge for me to learn new things (new syntax) on my own because I really don't have a single background of it. I really  enjoy my time in exploring in Html and Css but honestly I am not so good in desinging because it feels like it's not my forte in the field of IT. However, I believe that there is always a room for improvements of my skills and thats's why I am trying my best and as of now I'm just going to provide you a simple website. I hope you like it. </p>
